# The PIBIC Dream

PIBIC (Programa Institucional de Bolsas de Iniciação Científica) represents my first major academic milestone after entering UFABC. It's not just about the scholarship—it's about diving deep into research, learning from experienced researchers, and contributing to the field of computational neuroscience.

## Why PIBIC?

- **Early Research Experience**: Start contributing to real neuroscience research as an undergraduate
- **Mentorship**: Work closely with professors and graduate students
- **Foundation**: Build a strong research portfolio for future opportunities

## Goals

1. Find a research group aligned with computational neuroscience
2. Contribute to ongoing projects or start my own research
3. Learn advanced research methodologies
4. Publish or present findings at conferences

## Current Status

🟡 Planning phase - Preparing to apply once I enter UFABC
