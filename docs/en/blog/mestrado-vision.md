# My Master's Vision

My ultimate academic goal is to pursue a Master's degree in Computational Neuroscience, ideally with international experience through programs like BEPE (Bolsa de Estudos no Exterior).

## Why Master's?

- **Specialization**: Deep dive into computational neuroscience
- **Research Skills**: Advanced methodologies and analysis techniques
- **Network**: Connect with researchers globally
- **Career Preparation**: Foundation for PhD and research career

## The BEPE Dream

BEPE (Bolsa de Estudos no Exterior) would allow me to:
- Study at leading neuroscience institutions abroad
- Collaborate with international research groups
- Bring global perspectives back to Brazil
- Build an international academic network

## Ideal Program

**Institution**: Leading computational neuroscience programs (e.g., MIT, Stanford, UCL, Max Planck)
**Focus**: Neural computation, machine learning, neuroimaging
**Duration**: 6-12 months as part of Master's program

## Research Vision

By Master's, I aim to:
- Contribute to open-source neuroscience tools
- Publish research in computational neuroscience
- Present at international conferences
- Build a strong research portfolio

## Current Status

🔵 Vision phase - Long-term goal (2027+)
