## 💭 Daily Reflection

How was my day today? What did I learn? How did I feel?

My day was very good. I woke up feeling well-rested and energized. I was working on my side hustle project when I had a lot of progress to make. I created a plan for the next year to achieve my goals. Go to UFABC and learning more about neuroscience and artificial intelligence. I'm using a lot of LLM AI tools right now and try to mastering them.
