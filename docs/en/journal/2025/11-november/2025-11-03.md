## 📚 ENEM Study Plan

### Portuguese (Português)
**Today's topic:** Week 1 Review - Text Interpretation Fundamentals  
**Goals:**
- [ ] Review 5 different text genres (narrative, argumentative, informative, descriptive, instructional)
- [ ] Practice identifying main ideas and supporting arguments
- [ ] Complete 10 ENEM-style interpretation questions

**Time spent:** 1h 30min  
**Notes:**
Focus on understanding text structure and author's intent. Pay attention to implicit meanings and inferences.

### Mathematics (Matemática)
**Today's topic:** Foundations Week - Basic Operations & Percentages  
**Goals:**
- [ ] Master fraction operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- [ ] Solve 15 percentage problems (discounts, increases, compound calculations)
- [ ] Practice rule of three (simple and compound)

**Time spent:** 2h  
**Notes:**
Percentage is crucial for ENEM - appears in many contexts. Build strong foundation now.

### Natural Sciences (Ciências da Natureza)
**Today's topic:** Biology - Cell Structure & Function (Fundamentals Stage)  
**Goals:**
- [ ] Study prokaryotic vs eukaryotic cells
- [ ] Understand organelle functions (mitochondria, chloroplasts, nucleus, ER, Golgi)
- [ ] Create visual diagram of animal and plant cells with labels
- [ ] Review cellular respiration basics

**Time spent:** 1h 45min  
**Notes:**
Cells are the foundation of biology. Understanding this well makes all other topics easier.

### Humanities (Ciências Humanas)
**Today's topic:** History - Colonial Brazil (1500-1808)  
**Goals:**
- [ ] Understand Portuguese colonization motives and methods
- [ ] Study economic cycles: Brazilwood → Sugar → Gold
- [ ] Learn about indigenous peoples and African slavery
- [ ] Review social hierarchy in colonial period

**Time spent:** 1h 30min  
**Notes:**
Connect to modern Brazil's social and economic structures. ENEM loves interdisciplinary questions.

### Essay Writing (Redação)
**Today's topic:** Dissertation Structure & Introduction Techniques  
**Goals:**
- [ ] Study the 5 competencies of ENEM essay evaluation
- [ ] Learn 3 different introduction strategies (contextualization, question, quotation)
- [ ] Practice writing 3 introduction paragraphs on topic: "Digital Inclusion in Brazil"
- [ ] Review thesis statement construction

**Time spent:** 1h 15min  
**Notes:**
A strong introduction sets the tone. Practice the "context + problem + thesis" formula.

## 🧠 Computational Neuroscience

**Today's activity:** Introduction to Neurons & Neural Coding  
**Goals:**
- [ ] Read chapter on neuron structure and function
- [ ] Understand action potential mechanism
- [ ] Explore basic neural coding concepts (rate coding, temporal coding)

**Progress:**
Starting with biological foundations before moving to computational models.

**Concepts learned:**
- Neuron anatomy: dendrites, soma, axon, synapses
- Resting potential vs action potential
- All-or-nothing principle

**Code/Experiments:**
Planning to implement simple Hodgkin-Huxley model next week.

**Questions to explore:**
- How do neurons encode information?
- What is the relationship between firing rate and stimulus intensity?
- How does this connect to artificial neural networks?

## ✅ Daily Progress

**Completed Tasks:**
- [ ] Review all five ENEM subject areas
- [ ] Create summary notes for the week
- [ ] Practice essay introduction techniques
- [ ] Study cell biology fundamentals

**Study hours:** 8h (Sunday review session)

**Achievements:**
First full day of structured ENEM study! Established baseline understanding of all major areas.
