# The FAPESP Path

FAPESP (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo) scholarships represent the next step in my research journey. After building experience through PIBIC, FAPESP would allow me to dedicate more time to research with higher financial support.

## Why FAPESP?

- **Enhanced Research Focus**: More time dedicated to research
- **Academic Recognition**: Highly competitive and prestigious
- **Network**: Connect with top researchers in São Paulo
- **Preparation**: Excellent preparation for graduate studies

## Pathway

1. **PIBIC** (Undergraduate) → Build research foundation
2. **FAPESP IC** (Scientific Initiation) → Deepen research involvement
3. **FAPESP TT** (Technical Training) → Support research infrastructure
4. **FAPESP MS/DR** (Master's/Doctorate) → Graduate research funding

## Research Interests

- Computational modeling of neural circuits
- Neuroimaging data analysis
- Machine learning in neuroscience
- Open-source neuroscience tools

## Current Status

🔵 Vision phase - Long-term goal after establishing research track record
